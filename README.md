# Federated Learning Strategies and Experimentation Repository

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for exploring and implementing Federated Learning (FL) strategies. It combines various methodologies and experiments to demonstrate how distributed machine learning models can be collaboratively trained across multiple decentralized devices, while ensuring data privacy and security. 

## Overview

Federated Learning is a decentralized approach to training machine learning models, where data remains on individual devices, and only model updates (gradients or weights) are shared with a central server. This approach preserves data privacy and minimizes the risk of data breaches. The repository includes:

- **Implementation of Various FL Algorithms:** Incorporates several algorithms such as FedAvg, FedSGD, and more advanced techniques like FedProx and FedMA.
- **Experiments with Real and Simulated Datasets:** Includes experiments with synthetic data, as well as publicly available datasets, to illustrate how FL works in different scenarios.
- **Privacy and Security Considerations:** Highlights privacy-preserving techniques such as Differential Privacy (DP) and Secure Aggregation, ensuring that personal data remains secure during the learning process.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Provides tools for evaluating model performance and assessing key FL metrics, such as communication efficiency, convergence rate, and model accuracy.

## Key Features

- **Multi-device Simulation:** Simulates the behavior of distributed devices in a federated network, including scenarios of varying computational power, network conditions, and non-IID data distributions.
- **Comprehensive Experimentation Framework:** Supports customization of federated learning experiments with multiple configuration options, including different optimizers, learning rates, and communication strategies.
- **Integration of Open Source Tools:** Utilizes open-source libraries and frameworks to facilitate experimentation and benchmarking of different FL strategies.
